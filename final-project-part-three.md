# The final data story
https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/food-waste-on-college-campus/index.html

# Changes made since Part II
With the feedback I received, I changed a couple of titles for the graphs just for grammar purposes. Moreover, even though it is difficult to get the precise number, the National Resource Defence Council and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency suggest that college campuses around the US produce 20 million tons of food waste annually. With the suggestion of visualizing 20 million tons for the audience to connect more with the problem, I used Penn State's Beaver Stadium as a reference since through calculation with Bing AI, 20 million tons of food waste would fill up the whole stadium when stacked with a normal kitchen trash bin that is 13 gallon. Below is the interaction with Bing AI for the calculation:

## The audience
Connection is full circle with my Call To Action, and it is crucial to have collaborative efforts between legislators, universities, nonprofits, and students. All of these sectors are vital when addressing this issue. Hence, legislators, universities, nonprofits, and students are the final audiences.

## Final design decisions
The main shorthand wasn't edited much, except for the changes made since Part 2 mentioned above. I used Grammarly as a tool to check my grammar, but the main shorthand remains much the same. Also added reference page as I realized we need to include that not just in the Github.

# Final thoughts
The presentation went ok. I did run out of time a little and also the Beaver stadium reference should be clarified more that the 20 million tons of food waste is from the whole United States instead of just Pennsylvania. Overall, I do believe there are improvements to bring out the problem better and connect back to the call to action. 

I really enjoyed the class!! Loved all the presentations and really appreciate these different tools that can help us tell stories better. I really like Shorthand! Here is a final picture of my cats Toeby and Miso:
