# Outline
During my undergrad at Penn State (we are), I worked in the dining hall for the dorm on campus. As a former food server, I witnessed so much perfectly fine food getting thrown away at the end of the night. Additionally, the employees aren't supposed to take any of the food because it is technically "stealing". We of course took food, but there is only so much we can save. Hence, I aim to create a visualization that shows how much food waste schools created in Pennsylvania to bring awareness. Reducing food waste only requires a few steps and I believe it is something that could be solved with dedication.  
## Structure
For college campus dining, it falls under the category of "food services". Hence, the visualization will focus on food waste caused by the "college and university" category under food services produced per year in Pennsylvania. I aim to begin with mixed media demonstrating photos of food waste to introduce the problem. Then, I could present a line graph or bar graph that shows the composed amount of food services in Pennsylvania throughout the year. With the visualization showing that food waste has remained high throughout the years in PA, I would include the common cause of food waste on campus. This would rely more on survey data or case studies. This could potentially be visualized as well. Lastly, I would demonstrate a pie chart that shows the common food types that people waste.

# The data
ReFed is a nonprofit organization that works closely with federal and state governments to prevent food waste in the US. The data they provided includes food waste amounts in different states, sectors that produce food waste, and the cause throughout the year. They also included a grading system for how reliable their data are when looking into different topics related to food waste.

When looking at the main food type that people choose to waste, the data from Kaggle demonstrated which food type gets composed the most when in different environments, events conditions, and more. 

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is data that were collected by the government. They looked into different sectors of food waste more specifically. However, the data is old (2018 and 2019). 

Lastly, the Natural Resources Defense Council is also a nonprofit that works closely with public and private sectors to moderate resource waste. They have presented annual reports on food waste and have a team that is dedicated to reducing food waste. The report is helpful and detailed but requires outreach to receive the data table. I have already reached for it.

# Method and medium
I plan to use Tableau to create a visualization for the story, mainly. I also plan to explore Shorthand along the way to see if either tool helps present the data better. I have always been interested in mixed media, even though I have no concrete idea of what the mixed media will present at the end of the project, but I believe it would be an interesting route to explore.
