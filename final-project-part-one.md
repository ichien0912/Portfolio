# Outline
During my undergrad at Penn State (we are), I worked in the dining hall for the dorm on campus. As a former food server, I witnessed so much perfectly fine food getting thrown away at the end of the night. Additionally, the employees aren't supposed to take any of the food because it is technically "stealing". We of course took food, but there is only so much we can save. Hence, I aim to create a visualization that shows how much food waste schools created to bring awareness. Reducing food waste only requires a few steps and I believe it is something that could be solved with dedication.

> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
