# User research 

## Target audience
The primary audience I would like to reach is legislators who could change food regulations on same-day donations to food banks or non-profits. Due to food safety concerns, college campuses do  not tend to donate their food, even though we have to premake more food to ensure there is always enough food for the dining hall buffet. There is always untouched but cooked fresh food that could be donated. I hope legislators could propose a policy that mandates food safety and donating food from the dining hall or all buffets. 

Another target audience would be universities. To perhaps call on action for them to seek changes in regulations and start partnering up with food banks and non-profits to come up with ways that can save food while maintaining food safety.

## Interview script
The goal of the interview is to see if the storyboard clearly introduces the problem of food waste on college campuses and if the interviewee can receive the message of the call to action at the end. Additionally, the interview will aim to see what design or setup of the storyboard is confusing or unnecessary. The ultimate goal is to improve the storyboard and make the flow of my story cohesive. 

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
|To see if the interviewee got the topic of the story| Can you describe what the main topic of the storyboard is? |
|To see if there is anything unclear|Is there anything you find confusing?|
|If the story reaches the right audience | Do you think this storyboard will reach the right audience to act on the problem?|
|Design improvement| What do you think of the design? Does the flow seem right?|
|Overall improvement |What else would you change in this?|

|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
|**Is there anything you find confusing?**| Food waste produced by college campuses in Pennsylvania" for the title of the bar graph| Since the call of action is to donate the food, write a paragraph explaining how Buffet makes extra food and those can be donated. Not confusing with compost can be donated.              | Explain the visualization after you display it.            |
|                         | anaerobic digestion = composting. can save space  |             |             |
|                         | Explain some of the terms for people who don't know |             |             |
|**What do you think of the design? Does the flow seem right?**| It looks good, just remember to cite all images.         | Add a picture of the extra food at the buffet to clarify donation items.                               | I like to shadow transition for the cause of waste.             |             |
