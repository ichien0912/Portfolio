# Portfolio
This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories With Data at CMU!

# About Me
Hi! I am a Public Policy and Management master's student at CMU. My research interests are criminal justice reform, reentry, and trauma-informed care in the justice system. I have two cats, Toeby (he has extra toes) and Miso. 

# What I hope to Learn
I hope to develop skills that could help present data with better visualization and identify places to improve when I create visualizations for data. 

All of my work will be published below. Please hire me my cats need me.
