## Step Two: The Critique:
On the map data, the choice of different colors on circles for different flavors stood out to me. It demonstrated that the author had traveled throughout the whole of New York City to try out different flavors from different places to compare the prices. It somehow showed credibility by also tracking the collection process. The second graph used a line graph to show how the average price of pepperoni slices and the average price of the plain slice increased throughout the year. The choice of color and the use of a line graph clearly showed that prices for both flavors increased over time. 

The map is the first graph that the author demonstrated. However, with it being map form, it is very hard to see the trend of price per slice increasing throughout the year. Since it is the main statement from the author, it doesn't show the trend that the audience can see right away. Additionally, the second graph only demonstrated two flavors and their price change over time. It seems that pepperoni and plain are the top two flavors the author consumes, thereby having more data. The author should state the reason why other flavors are not included. Moreover, the author only stated that plain slices' price went up. Then why does he include pepperoni in the line graph as well? Need to be explained.

I would probably demonstrate all the flavors in the line graph to see if the plain flavor's price increased the most over time compared to other flavors. In this case, pepperoni seems to increase the most, so I would change the statement. 

The primary audience for this tool would be New York City residents who enjoy pizza. The map shows where the pizzeria is, the flavor, and the price in different years. The visualization will reach the audience, with the map and good tracking of the pizzeria the author went to. But I argue it is not effective. All the pizzerias are different, the only constant variable is the flavors. Each spot where visited at a different time. There could be a lot of confounders that affect the price of the same flavor throughout the year. Hence, the statement was not demonstrated well through the visualization.

<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1731610894321');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

In the original line graph that shows the increasing trend for pizza slice prices throughout the years, the author only included pepperoni and plain slices for comparison. However, the statement for the line graph focuses only on Plain without explaining the way it did not explain pepperoni price also increased as well. Hence, I looked into the styles that the author ordered most throughout the years. Then, I created a line graph that included the 4 styles that have the most data in the table, which are pepperoni, plain, Sicilian, and white pizza. I included the average price for each style with grey line labels and also included the label of the most recent average price for each style. These data excluded dollar slices as they remained the same price throughout the years.

<script type='text/javascript'>                    
  var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1731617412641');                    
  var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    
  var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    
  scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                
</script>

After receiving the feedback, I decided to focus back on the two styles that the author tried out the most throughout the eight years. I changed the visualization into a bar graph as it showed a bigger change in trend compared to the line graph. I had the bar graphs side-to-side using different colors that correlate with the styles to differentiate. I added a trend line so it clearly showed the price increased throughout the years. I also added the price in 2014 (oldest) and the price of 2022 (most recent). This demonstrated again the trend of price increases.
